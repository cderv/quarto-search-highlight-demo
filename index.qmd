## About This Demo

This site demonstrates the search highlight fix from [quarto-dev/quarto-cli#14047](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/14047). When you navigate to a page with a `?q=term` parameter in the URL, matching terms are highlighted with a yellow background. This is the same mechanism used when you click a search result in the Quarto search box.

## How to Test

Try these links to see search highlighting in action:

- [Pandas page with "data" highlighted](pandas.html?q=data)
- [Visualization page with "chart" highlighted](visualization.html?q=chart)
- [Modeling page with "regression" highlighted](modeling.html?q=regression)

You can also use the search box in the top navigation bar. Type a term like "data", then click on one of the results. The destination page should scroll to and highlight the matching text.

## The Bug

In previous versions of Quarto, search highlights were cleared almost immediately after page load. Layout-settling events (`quarto-hrChanged` and `quarto-sectionChanged`) fired within the first ~24ms and triggered a `defined(defined())` call chain that wiped the `<mark>` elements before users could see them.

## The Fix

The fix delays the registration of highlight-clearing event listeners by 1000ms, giving the initial layout events time to settle before the listeners become active. This ensures that search highlights remain visible when navigating from search results.

See [PR #14049](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/pull/14049) for the implementation details.

## Content for Searching

This site includes several pages with data science content to provide realistic search targets. Each page covers a different topic — data manipulation with pandas, data visualization, and statistical modeling — with enough prose to exercise the search and highlight functionality across multiple pages.
